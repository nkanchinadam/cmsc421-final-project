CMSC421 Final Project

## Description:
For our final project, we will be fine-tuning an existing image classifier that classifies movie genres according to posters using an IMDB dataset. We will try multiple existing models to fine tune the data. We hope to fine-tune it to be able to classify an even greater number of genres given any movie poster and improve its accuracy by narrowing down the classification from multiple genres to fewer or to be able to classify the movie into greater than three genres. To perform the fine-tuning we will be following the referenced pytorch tutorial. We will likely be testing different hyperparameters like learning rate and loss functions.
